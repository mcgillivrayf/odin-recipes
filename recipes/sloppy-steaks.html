    <h1>Sloppy steaks: a meal that needs no introduction.</h1> 
    
    <p>Have you found yourself missing those late nights after the club at Truffoni's? Did your hair used 
        to slick back <i>real</i> nice? This recipe will take you back to those dangerous nights and remind 
        you of the huge piece of shit that you used to be!</p>

        <p>This recipe is as simple as it gets. You'll only need two ingredients:
            <ul>
                <li>Steak</li>
                <li>Water</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Preparation, in three simple steps:
            <ol>
                <li>Start by cooking your steak, but <strong>make sure not to overdo it</strong>-- you want to be left 
            with a big rare cut of meat-- it'll make the night so much more fun.</li>
                <li>Assure the staff at Truffoni's (or whoever is around, such as family members or dinner guests) that 
                    you have no intention of slopping up your steak-- try to feign offense at the suggestion that someone like 
                    yourself would slop up your steak against their wishes to come off that much more genuine. </li>
                <li>Slop em up! Dump your water all over it! Eat as fast as you can while the water sloshes all over the table!</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        
        <p> You've done it! Of course people can change, but everyone deserves to be a piece of shit for a night if they choose.
            To make this recipe extra fun, consider slicking your hair back, or even going for spiked up blonde hair and a pair 
            of little bitty jeans. Enjoy!
        </p>
